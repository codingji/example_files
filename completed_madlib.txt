"If you can't crawl them, harp them." - That's what my mushy portopotty always used to tell me. It's been a puny life trying to learn these lessons, but I know I can timidly crawl that I am a better temple because of them. "If there's a belt, there's a bear" - is another saying my puny hair used to say alot to me as a kid. I used to think they were mushy, but now I know better. My advice to youngsters these days would be "Don't timidly snip a dark quail."
