"If you can't %{Verbs} them, %{Verbs} them." -  That's what my %{Adjectives} %{Nouns} always used to tell me. It's been a %{Adjectives} life trying to learn these lessons, but I know I can %{Adverbs} %{Verbs} that I am a better %{Nouns} because of them.

"If there's a %{Nouns}, there's a %{Nouns}" - is another saying my %{Adjectives} %{Nouns} used to say alot to me as a kid. I used to think they were %{Adjectives}, but now I know better. My advice to youngsters these days would be "Don't %{Adverbs} %{Verbs} a %{Adjectives} %{Nouns}."
